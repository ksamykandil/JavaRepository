This is the repository where I share some snippet of my code like the library I'm using in online programming contests "Just a beginner", some techniques, etc

I've been using java for a while, but I'm starting to be involved in the community.

Contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaledkandil">LinkedIn</a> for any comments, more than welcomed :)
